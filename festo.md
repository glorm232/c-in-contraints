## Core Principles
- Constraint-driven creativity
- Hard limits are intentional
- Simple surface, deep internals
- Learn by breaking and rebuilding
- Projects > explanations

## Non-Goals
- Framework-heavy development
- Web apps
- High-level abstractions without understanding

If a task does not produce visible or audible results,
it is probably wrong.
