### C in Constraints
M=Fufilling my desire to learn C by building visual systems with audio and physical components that are freeform and laid out in a way that follows no standard or criteria. 

Textbooks will take a backseat at times along with long abstract exercises that produce things I have no interest in. Essentially these projects will follow a single rule, in the end can we see, hear, or touch it.

Constraints > convenience
